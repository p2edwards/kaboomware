# p2e's games

I'm making games.

```

```

## Playing 🎮

🎮 Each game should [play normally](https://github.com/p2edwards/kaboomware/blob/6d68a56e1f43c559796333f2213730c1a54b1411/README.md?plain=1#L29-L33) from the [📁kaboomware](../../) dev commands without any extra steps.

## Reading  📚

I'm using [🦝 **Civet**](https://civet.dev/) to generate my TypeScript because I like it.

📚 **You don't need to know Civet** to read the source code. 

Although I use Civet as a shorthand, I've taken special care to make sure the TS code stays readable.


**📘 TypeScript** versions are **checked into the Git repo** alongside their **🦝 Civet** sources.

## Developing ⌨️

To watch & recompile **.civet** scripts to **.ts**,

- 📥 Install dependencies: `cd _tools && npm install`
- 🦝 Run watch script: `node civet-watch`

### Notes

- All scripts to support Civet files are installed under [📁games/p2e/_tools](./_tools) to avoid cluttering the [📁kaboomware](../../) folder.
- The **📄 tsconfig.json** helps my TypeScript resolve `"kaboomware"`.


## What games? 👽

[📁_tools](./_tools) is not a game. 🛸 You're early. Check back later. 🌎  Thanks for visiting! 🖖
